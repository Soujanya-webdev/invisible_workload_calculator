✨ Making the Invisible Visible

The Invisible Workload Calculator quantifies the massive but often overlooked value of unpaid household work such as cooking, cleaning, childcare, and caregiving.
By combining real-time calculations with visual charts, this tool demonstrates how much economic value unpaid labor adds to families and societies.

📌 Problem Statement

Every day, millions of people (especially women) spend hours on unpaid household work.
Although this work is essential for families and the economy, it is not counted in GDP or given financial recognition.

This project helps people see the hidden economic contribution of unpaid work by translating it into daily, monthly, and annual wage equivalents.

🚀 Features

💡 Thought-Provoking Elements

Headline: “Unpaid work has real value.”

Bottom quote: “If unpaid household work was counted in GDP, it would add billions.”

⚙️ How It Works

Enter the average hourly wage in your locality.

Input the number of hours spent daily on each household activity.

The calculator instantly computes the daily, monthly, and annual economic value.

A pie chart visualizes the time distribution across different activities.

📂 Tech Stack

HTML5 – Structure

Tailwind CSS – Styling & responsive layout

JavaScript (Vanilla) – Core logic & calculations

Chart.js – Interactive data visualization

💡 Example Impact

If someone spends 8 hours/day on unpaid work with a wage rate of ₹250/hour:

₹2,000/day

₹60,000/month

₹7,30,000/year (~$8,500)

👉 That’s equivalent to a full-time salaried job, yet it remains invisible.

🌍 Why This Matters

Unpaid household work sustains economies but isn’t recognized in GDP.

By making this invisible workload visible, we can spark conversations about fairness, recognition, and policy change.

🔮 Future Improvements

Export results as a sharable card (social media ready).

Save weekly/monthly logs with localStorage.

Add regional wage presets (India, US, EU, etc.).

Compare workload between family members.
